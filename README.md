An Android Live Wallpaper featuring the current Desert Bus For Hope shift banner, year-round.

This is a simple Live Wallpaper that puts the current shift banner as your wallpaper.  By "current", I mean using the standard Desert Bus shifts, even if Desert Bus isn't going right now:

* Midnight - 6am: Zeta Shift
* 6am - Noon: Dawnguard
* Noon - 6pm: Alpha Flight
* 6pm - Midnight: Night Watch

By default, this will use Moonbase Standard Time (PST/PDT).  You can change it to your phone's local time if you want, but c'mon.

There's also an option to read from the VST whether or not it's Omega Shift.  This is the only reason this app needs any network permissions (there's no way to determine that otherwise).  It's set to trigger every ten minutes when the wallpaper is visible and if it's November (Desert Bus is always in November).
