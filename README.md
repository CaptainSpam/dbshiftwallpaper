An Android Live Wallpaper featuring the current Desert Bus For Hope shift banner, year-round.

This is a simple Live Wallpaper that puts the current shift banner as your wallpaper.  By "current", I mean using the standard Desert Bus shifts, even if Desert Bus isn't going right now:

* Midnight - 6am: Zeta Shift
* 6am - Noon: Dawnguard
* Noon - 6pm: Alpha Flight
* 6pm - Midnight: Night Watch

By default, this will use Moonbase Standard Time (PST/PDT).  You can change it to your phone's local time if you want, but c'mon.

Future planned functionality includes reading the DB API (if it still exists) so the app can throw up Omega Shift when DB is actually happening.
